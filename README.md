What's here?
------------

This repository contains functions for downloading observational data using APIs
provided by the Climate Data Store (CDS) and the European Centre for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and for standardizing and consolidating the data into
time series and averages. Currently only supports ERA-Interim data but in the future
will include MERRA-2, NCAR CFSR, and other *in situ* and satellite products from CDS.
